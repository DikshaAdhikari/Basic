# Basic
Uses Vanilla JS instead of jsx.

We are writing our class components and functional components. Its's just that with jsx we don't have to call React.createElement constantly. JSX knows to read from that HTML markup that we were writing and that's why jsx is so good when we use it with react because it is not redundant. Jsx is a quality improvement.
